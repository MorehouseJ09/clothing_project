Jon Morehouse's Jquery Plugin Library
=

This repository is going to hold all of my jquery plugins and libraries.
I'm planning to modularize all of my code that I use in projects into one easily installable bower package (this) that can be dropped into any existing project etc...

Some Dependencies / Usage Cases
=

We will assume that we are using coffeescript underneath require.js. These libraries will be using both the hammer.js javascript libraries and jquery etc.
