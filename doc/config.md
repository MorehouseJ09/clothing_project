Custom Compass Plugins 
=

I've forked some repos online and am going to make my own plugin system with the stuff I'm working on here!

The Mixins folder should become a gem at some point

Or make my entire Compass set up a gem?

On generate, have the compass application add the configuration etc into the proper files?
	
	Or have it create a task that will add the proper bundle exec compass install?
